        <h1>Tech</h1>
        <h3>Windows 98</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
          <p>I'm pretty sure it was Windows 98, the first computer OS I ever used. I grew up out in the country, west of Shelby, MI. It's where there were a lot of trees, slow internet (anyone remember dial-up PeoplePC?), and a quiet, peaceful environment. We were taught how to use a Windows computer. It was an experience I didn't know was possible. I controlled the cursor on the screen with a mouse including an exposed ball underneath. My imagination was wild in <em>Microsoft Paint</em> and <em>Office</em> products.</p>
          <p>I can't remember if every Windows computer had this game preinstalled at the time, but <em>3D Pinball Space Cadet</em> was super fun. I know this because we eventually got our own Windows computer. To use a computer in a public setting is one thing, but to have it in your own home was spectacular.</p>

        <h3>iPod</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
          <p>I never really liked music growing up. In fact, there were a lot of things I didn't enjoy in my youth:</p>
          <div class="dislike-list">
            <ul class="row leftColumn">
              <li>music</li>
              <li>summer heat</li>
              <li>weddings</li>
              <li>thunderstorms</li>
              <li>LOUD MUSIC</li>
              <li>sweet frosting</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="rightColumn">
            <p>You may be thinking: what kid doesn't like any of these things except thunderstorms?</p>
            <br>
            <h4>That kid was me.</h4>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <p>But there was a certain time I wished I listened to music. My brother wanted an iPod Nano for his birthday; he got one.</p>
          <p>My mom and I were at Walmart searching for the iPod that he wanted. When I found it, I told my mom, she told an employee, the employee opened the glass door, got the iPod, and returned to the register with my mom and I.</p>
          <p>The journey back home had me looking at the iPod that we had just gotten for my brother's birthday. It was a <strong>beautiful</strong> device, wishing I had my own. But there was no reason for me to have my own. From that point on, I had a serious interest for Apple products.</p>

        <h3>RPG Maker</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
          <p>As the years went on, my experience with the PC grew. From <em>Mavis Beacon</em> to creating annoying slideshow presentations in <em>Microsoft PowerPoint</em>, the window of possibility only kept getting wider. In high school, I would make YouTube videos to showcase my <em>Guitar Hero</em> skills. They were bad quality videos, but I used my personal laptop to edit them. Then, after I graduated high school, I came across a site, <em>RPG Maker</em>.</p>
          <p>This was a short lived moment for me, but it was pretty fun to use the software. This was the second time I learned some basic coding; my first time learning basic HTML in high school. I got really into it for a short while. But then my architectural classes took over my desire to keep playing with it.</p>

        <h3>BlackBerry to Samsung Galaxy</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
          <p>It was time to upgrade my purple LG slider phone. When looking for phones, I really liked the look and functionality of the BlackBerry Bold 9900. At this time, the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy phones were already out, but having the physical keyboard hit home with me. I got it and I was made fun of by my siblings.</p>
          <p>To this day, it was the best <strong>PHONE</strong> I have ever used in my life. Not the best smartphone, but the best phone hands down. Of course, it lacked apps like Instagram and other games, so eventually I grew tired of it and upgraded to an HTC One M8. Then I got my first Samsung phone; the Samsung Galaxy S7.</p>
          <p>This was truly "groundbreaking" for me as it was my first phone to have a great camera, faster and smoother OS, and better battery life. The speakers were lacking compared to the HTC phone I had but it was still sufficient. I stayed with Samsung phones for a while up until the Samsung Galaxy S21. I was growing tired of Samsung phones as the same thing would happen to me every time: blazing fast, great battery life to laggy, poor battery life after one year.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Apple and beyond</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
          <p>I wanted something different. Something that just about all my family members have. I wanted to switch to the iPhone.</p>
          <p>I switched. I got a Product (RED) iPhone 13. It was beautiful and seamless. It was far more convenient to text many of the people on my contacts. Also, with the included FaceTime, AirDrop, and other features, it felt like I was a part of something now, as dramatic as that sounds.</p>
          <p>Then, I got a MacBook Pro M1. This was at the time I was wanting to get out of my CAD drafting position to go to school full time for web development. Because of this, I thought I would switch my tech over from Android and Windows to just pure Apple. This would enable me to learn how to use macOS and I'm glad I did. I've used macOS at my graphic design classes and at my internship in Grand Rapids, MI. Had I not learned how to use macOS prior to starting school, I feel like I would have struggled in class and at my internship.</p>
          <p>Eventually, I got more Apple products. AirPods Pro, iPad Air, Apple Watch SE, Apple Card, and more. I've enjoyed everything from it so far.</p>
